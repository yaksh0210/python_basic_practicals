# Call .rjust() on the_string with 17 as its argument and print() the result.
print(the_string.rjust(17))

# Call .ljust() on the_string with the arguments 17 and "*" then print() the result.
print(the_string.ljust(17,"*"))

# Create a variable called center_plus and assign it the result of .center() being called on the_string with 16 and "+" as arguments.
center_plus = the_string.center(16,"+")

# Use print() to display the string assigned to center_plus.
print(center_plus)

# Call .lstrip() on the_string to remove "North" then print() the result.

# Call .rstrip() on center_plus with "+" as its argument and print() the result.
print(center_plus.rstrip("+"))

# Call .strip() on center_plus with "+" as its argument and print() the result.
print(center_plus.strip("+"))

# Call .replace() on the_string and replace "North" with "South".  print() the result.
