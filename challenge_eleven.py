# For this challenge, you will be writing a program which uses a for loop to reverse a string. 
# Start by creating a variable and assigning it a string as user input using input().
# Use a for loop to reverse the string.  You will need to use range with all 3 inputs for this.  In addition, you should create a variable before the for loop and assign it an empty string.  The variable will be reassigned multiple times within the for loop and end up holding the new reversed string.
# Print the reversed string at the bottom of your program.

var = input("enter your string: ")
rev = ""

for i in range(len(var) -1, -1 ,-1 ):
    rev += var[i]

print(rev)
