# Do all of this in a .py file:

# Create a variable and assign it a list that contains an integer, a float, a Boolean value, a string, and a list of 3 integers.
demo_list = [10, 2.5, True, "Hello", [1 ,2, 3]]

# Create another variable and assign it a call of the list() function with a string as its argument.
my_list = list("Hey There")

# Use the keyword "in" to check if the letter "e" is in the list assigned to the variable from step 2 and print the result.
print("e" in my_list)

# Use the keyword "not in" to check if the letter "a" is not in the list assigned to the variable from step 2 and print the result.
print("a" not in my_list)
